"""PUT: create a file or overwrite one in place.

Unlike Drive's upload endpoint this never auto-renames — an existing target is
overwritten at the same entity, which is what Office/Finder save flows
(LOCK → PUT → UNLOCK) require. (Disk targets keep their storage key too; on S3
each PUT writes a fresh generation key that the commit publishes — see
_stage_s3_generation.) The body spools through a scratch
file with SHA-256 computed on the way (constant memory under the
streaming_request_paths hook), and `X-OC-Mtime` is honored so rclone's
nextcloud vendor round-trips modification times.
